# Speed-Detector-Monitoring-system-using-Arduino
Polish up your robotics/coding skills by building this simple speed detector system using Arduino.

Components:
Arduino Uno Rev3
Male/Female Jumper Wires
2 IR Sensors
Active Buzzer
Male/Male Jumper Wires
5mm Green LED
16 X 2 LCD with I2C Adapter

Description:
Learn how to build a speed detector using an Arduino Uno R3, LCD screen with I2C module, IR sensors, buzzers and LED. the object in question should be moved from IR A to IR B(as mentioned in the code). A green LED is used to indicate whether the detector is ready to measure the speed of another object(indicated by the "on" state)and is turned off when already measuring an object's speed. An active buzzer is used to sound a warning when the speed is over a certain limit (8 km/h in this case). The LCD screen is used to display the speed reading and issue warnings when needed. This is a beginner-friendly robotics project ideal for anyone interested in arduino/robotics and wants to step into the field, perfect for students or hobbyists as it uses low-cost components while teaching the  practical applications of sensors and LCD screens at the same time.
